This directory contains scripts that were used in the development of the Activity Log.
Any / all Activity Log interaction with elasticsearch can also be done with a 'curl' command,
and commands were developed / tested here first, before converting to json/ruby and combining
the pieces in order to send the constructed request thru the RestClient in the common_controller.

The request that is sent out by the controller may be seen in the rails console or log.  As for
the result, the controller parses it in to a json object and takes only the fields that it
cares about.  With these curl scripts, you will see the full json response.

If you need to understand what Activity Log is doing for a given operation, it may be helpful to
review / run the corresponding curl script first.

If you need to add new elasticsearch queries to manage-web, you can develop (and preserve) the
corresponding curl(s) here first, if needed.

For a quick one-line explanation of the scripts here, run the 'describe' script.
