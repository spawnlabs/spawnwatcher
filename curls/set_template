'set_template' was used to apply a template with the hostname 'not_analyzed' mapping,
so that new indexes created by logstash will automatically have the desired
mapping.  Initially, the errors reported when I tried to change the mapping made me 
believe that it was not possible to change a field that had already been established, 
so I tried the 'multi' field approach that left 'hostname' as it was originally 
defined but added a 'not_analyzed' variation aliased to 'na_hostname', and it worked.  
Later, discovered that the original field could be changed after all; the earlier 
failure was probably just due to bad syntax.
